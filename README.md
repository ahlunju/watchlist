Small Backbone app that searches from an API, and storing data in localstorage. Totally awesome.

=========
Libraries and frameworks I used:
- jQuery/jQueryUI
- Backbone
- Underscore
- RequireJS

Requirements:

Your task is to create a simple “watchlist” application using the search API.
This task requires two components:
1. The user should be able to enter a search term and be presented with a list of matching
TV shows and movies. Results should include a thumbnail of the item and its title. The
user should be able to add any of these items to the top of their “watchlist”.
2. In the watchlist users should be able to remove items and have some method of
rearranging them (up/down buttons, drag and drop, etc). The watchlist should be
persisted using some form of client side storage (localStorage, cookies, IndexedDB,
etc).
You may use whatever JavaScript libraries and frameworks you like, however we ask that you
do not use any external CSS libraries. You may use precompilers (such as CoffeeScript, SASS,
LESS, etc) but please include a fully compiled version of your code that can be tested directly.
You will be primarily evaluated on the quality and structure of your code. You will not be
evaluated on your design skills, however your code should adequately express the depth and
breadth of your CSS knowledge. Your example will be evaluated in the latest stable version of
Chrome, so you may (and are encouraged to) use the latest and greatest browser technologies
and need not worry about browser compatibility.
